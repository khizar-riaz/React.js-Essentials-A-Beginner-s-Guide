## :star2: React Introduction

#### What is React?
  
- React, sometimes referred to as a `frontend JavaScript framework`, is a `JavaScript library` created by `Facebook`.
- React is a tool for building `UI components`.

#### How does React Work?

- Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a `virtual DOM in memory`, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.

#### React Getting Started

- To use React in production, you need `npm` which is included with `Node.js`.
- To get an overview of what React is, you can write React code directly in HTML.
- But in order to use React in production, you need npm and Node.js installed.

#### React Directly in HTML

- The quickest way start learning React is to write React directly in your HTML files.
- This way of using React can be OK for testing purposes, but for production you will need to set up a React environment.

#### Setting up a React Environment

- If you have npx and Node.js installed, you can create a React application by using following command:


```

npx create-react-app

```

- NPM is a package manager used to install, delete, and update Javascript packages on your machine. 
- NPX is a package executer, and it is used to execute javascript packages directly, without installing them.

#### Run the React Application

- Now you are ready to run your first real React application!
- Run this command to move to the my-react-app directory:

```

cd my-react-app

```

- Run this command to run the React application my-react-app:

```

npm start

```

- A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! If not, open your browser and type `localhost:3000` in the address bar.

#### Modify the React Application

- Look in the `my-react-app directory`, and you will find a src folder. Inside the src folder there is a file called `App.js`.
- Try changing the HTML content and save the file.
- Notice that the changes are visible immediately after you save the file, you do not have to reload the browser!

#### What's Next?

- Now you have a React Environment on your computer, and you are ready to learn more about React.
